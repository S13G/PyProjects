## PUZZMIC

Puzzmic is a memory puzzle created using one of python famous libraries "Pygame".

In this game, all icons are covered with white boxes with every icon in each box having a duplicate of itself (Same 
color, Same shape; not more than 2). 

The player can click on the white boxes covering the icons to display the icons hidden behind them. If the icons 
match, then those boxes remained uncovered, if they don't, they are closed immediately so the player can move on in 
finding a matching piece for the icons previously viewed or continue opening the other boxes.

### How to win
The player wins when all the boxes in the game are uncovered. To give the player a hint, the boxes are quickly 
uncovered once at the beginning of the game.
